# Fullstack Dev install script
  This script is to install all the libraries/packages I normally need to add on a fresh install.
  The process to set up a new ubuntu/linux machine is can be tedious and slow, so thats the main reason I created
  this script for me and my co-workers.

  Just run `./install.sh`, and it will guide you through the steps.
